It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single\r\n    output.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><u>INGTEGRATION SYSTEM:</u>\r\n    Integration testing is a level of software testing where individual\r\n    units are\r\n    combined and tested as a group.

        '<p>The purpose of Regression Testing is to verify if code change introduces\r\n    issues/defects into the existing functionality. There are so many kinds\r\n    of\r\n    possible changes that can impact the existing functionality in an\r\n    application\r\n    system. Even the simplest change to the code could impact the previously\r\n    tested\r\n    functionality. Regression is initiated when a programmer fixes any bug\r\n    or adds a\r\n    new code for new functionality to the system. There can be many\r\n    dependencies in\r\n    the newly added and existing functionality. It is a quality measure to\r\n    check\r\n    whether the new code complies with the old code so that the unmodified\r\n    code is\r\n    not getting affected. Most of the time the testing team has the task to\r\n    check\r\n    the last minute changes in the system. In such a situation, testing only\r\n    affected application area is necessary to complete the testing process\r\n    on time\r\n    by covering all the major system aspects.\r\n    This test is very important when there is a continuous\r\n    change/improvement added\r\n    in the application. The new functionality should not negatively affect\r\n    the\r\n    existing tested code. Regression is required to find the bugs that\r\n    occurred\r\n    because of a change in the code. If this testing is not done, the\r\n    product might\r\n    get critical issues in the live environment and that indeed can lead the\r\n    customer into trouble.\r\n</p>',
