                                        has shown that many large projects fail because of inadequate requirements.
                                        Requirements elicitation explores the problem world. It is one of the most
                                        important and sensitive practices in software engineering projects as it deals
                                        with the origins of a project.
                                        Requirements elicitation is composed of information gathering from users,
                                        stakeholders, and other technical and non-technical groups.
                                        The majority of the technical requirements are not documented anywhere and has
                                        to be discovered as it resides in the minds of the stakeholders.
                                        Since different issues arise overtime within the Software Development Life Cycle
                                        (SDLC), the elicitation process becomes more complicated with the changing
                                        stakeholder requirements.
                                        The article below discusses different aspects for this software engineering
                                        skill.

                                        Requirements elicitation is a skill that requires both, strong technical skills
                                        in addition to strong non-technical (soft skills).
                                        Bridging between business problems and its technological solution involves both,
                                        a lot of interaction with the stakeholders and strength in understanding the
                                        technology (software).
                                        Therefore, the requirement analyst should have sufficient software knowledge to
                                        be able to gather the technical constraints in addition to being a great
                                        communicator.</p>

                                    <p>To clarify more the important skills for a good requirement analyst who can
                                        elicit requirements:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Fundamentals skills: One must possess communication skills, management
                                            skills, problems solving skills, as well as research skills.</li>
                                        <li>Business Analysis skills: Comprehension and documentations skills are
                                            paramount to this role especially when coupled with creativity.</li>
                                        <li>Technical skills: Knowledge of software and IT skills in addition to

                                        A requirement analyst is needed to conduct elicitation. Experience in
                                        understanding the problem domains of different software project and identifying
                                        the critical system stakeholders are important traits.
                                        Prerequisites for this skill include excellent communication skills to interact
                                        with the stakeholders for interviews, run background studies for the
                                        system-to-be, and gather useful data through questionnaires, flowcharts and
                                        surveys.
                                        A good requirement analyst also must have a strong eye for scope to help the
                                        stakeholders narrow down requirements toward a set of important requirements
                                        that can be implemented.

                                    <p>
                                        Requirements elicitation is a skill that has a big role in determining the level
                                        of success of a certain project, therefore it plays a big role in a project's
                                        fate.
                                        With the endless and changing requests of stakeholders, the requirement analyst
                                        working in the elicitation plays an important part in this role.
                                        This skill was chosen because it extracts useful requirements and helps software
                                        engineers select the correct elicitation techniques for identifying the right
                                        stakeholders and paves the way towards the right interaction.
                                        Organizational and technical constraints for the system-to-be is also clarified
                                        in the elicitation phase. </p>
                                    </p> With all of this in place, the elicitation
                                    done helps to minimize errors or missing requirements, after the project's
                                    delivery, that is usually costing hundred times more to fix.
                                    Since there will be continuous discussions with the stakeholders, alternative
                                    feasible solutions are always suggested to satisfy the completion of the project
                                    within the given timeframe meeting the delivery deadline.
                                    For example, a requirement engineer would explain what is meant by a “wicked
                                    problem”, by providing examples of such problems (in one of the meetings with
                                    stakeholders) to avoid having any.

                                        The Requirement Engineer and Technical requirement analyst play an essential
                                        role in requirement engineering and specifically in requirements elicitation.
                                        They are responsible in eliciting the needed requirements from main users and
                                        other stakeholders. Since the RE/BA are responsible in capturing the intial
                                        details from the customer/stakeholders, they have a responsibility to minimze
                                        the cognitive distance with the software PM/development team.

                                        After gathering several requirements through various elicitation techniques (and
                                        possibly selecting the most optimal approaches), requirement modeling is
                                        produced once all the requirements are elicited.
                                        The requirement modeling can be modeled using UML (Unified Modeling Language),
                                        while it is provided to the clients/stakeholders in the business language. Use
                                        case diagrams and activity diagrams would also accomplish this.

                                        Selecting One artifact-driven elicitation technique that could be used would be
                                        Card sorts and Repository grids.
                                        A hypothetical example would be having an open dialogue to discuss a project
                                        similar to a streaming website, such as "YouTube". The scenario provided is
                                        based on the <em> Brainstorming and User Story </em>
                                        technique. In this scenario, "the card" was used to note down these
                                        requirements.</p>
                                    <p>The round of discussions for gathering requirements would be as follows (written
                                        down on the Cards):</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li> <em> Point 1:</em> "A Website for streaming Videos created by Users."</li>
                                        <li> <em>Point 2:</em> "Different types of users exist. Some are contributors,
                                            and some are only watchers (users streaming videos only) "</li>
                                        <li> <em>Point 3:</em> "The contributors would be called creators. And as a
                                            creator, they can upload videos 24/7."</li>

                                        <br>
                                        At this point, there can be a conversation or an open dialogue discussion on the
                                        points written down on the cards:

                                        Research papers and academic books nurture the idea of elicitation.
                                        Currently, there is a focus on the types of interviews being done, and whether
                                        they are structured interviews or unstructured, to check which collects more
                                        information compared to the other.
                                        Different research papers are conducting surveys and evaluating some techniques
                                        for eliciting requirements of computer-based systems, paying particular

                                    <p>
                                        6/10</p>
                                    <p>The best way to assess and self-evaluate is to measure <em>what one knows versus
                                            what one does not know</em>.
                                        My knowledge in this area is limited to the readings I have done, in addition to
                                        eliciting requirements for projects done in Academia, however not in practical
                                        real world projects.
                                        This is the main reason why I would give myself this rating, as I feel I am
                                        lacking adequate industry experience, and as a result, I may have missed
                                        touching some corners.
                                        In addition to that, I cannot judge how useful a Group Brainstorming session
                                        with multiple stakeholder is, compared with a one-on-one interview with a
                                        stakeholder, and which is more effective in terms of communication channel and
                                        productivity.
                                        This rating is based on my understanding, after acknowledging and realizing how
                                        important it is to elicite. The input it provides is massive to steer a project
                                        in the right path.
                                        In addition to that, I think there could be some issues in recalling all of the
                                        points being discussed after every successive interview/meeting. Also, there
                                        should be equal attention on all details being discussed (so there is nothing
                                        missed).
                                        Elicitation requirements sheds the light and emphasizes how important
                                        communication and agreement are for the success of a project.
