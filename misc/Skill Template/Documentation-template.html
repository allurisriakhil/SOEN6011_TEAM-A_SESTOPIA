                                            software engineering knowledge and expertise to build the required mental
                                            model for proper documentation.<br>
                                            It can also be classified as a knowledge-based skill because it requires
                                            some form of technical knowledge to an extent.

                                            The Significance of software documentation has been emphasized by numerous
                                            researchers over the years each
                                            explicitly explaining the reasons why software documentation should be
                                            considered important.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            In( parnas,2011) The author stated that “The prime cause of the sorry “state
                                            of the art” in software development
                                            is our failure to produce good design documentation.” . He stated that the
                                            lack proper documentation
                                            during the development process is the cause of many errors and it reduces
                                            efficiency in a software product
                                            development and use .As such to ensure software systems of good quality and
                                            maintainable quality are developed,
                                            it is important for software developers to have good documentation skill
                                            alongside other soft skills and hard
                                            skills required for the job.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Also, In (Kipyegen & Korir, 2013) titled “Importance of software
                                            Documentation” the authors stated
                                            that “Documentation is an activity that needs to commence early in
                                            development and continue
                                            throughout the development lifecycle”. This implies that documentation is
                                            prevalent
                                            throughout all the phases of development in a proper development life cycle
                                            as such there is need
                                            for the documentation skill at every phase of the software development to
                                            ensure maintainability of the
                                            software and increase the probability of re-use, which increases the
                                            importance of the documentation skill.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Finally, over the years, it has been concluded by multiple researchers that
                                            good documentation is important for
                                            posterity sake, it increases the lifespan ultimately of the software system
                                            .

                                        <p>
                                            In Schools, most tertiary institutions have courses that study each of the
                                            phases
                                            in the software engineering life cycle in their software engineering
                                            programs.
                                            These courses introduce the artifact produced by that phase of the process.
                                            Documentations are artifacts produced at the end of some development process
                                            phases
                                            .<br>

                                            So, academia contributes to the knowledge of the documentation skill through
                                            courses in the programs and school projects for the experience. Schools also
                                            cultivate this skill by teaching about the importance of documentation
                                            through courses
                                            like software maintenance and refactoring.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            In the industry, organizations mostly with high process maturity levels
                                            focus
                                            on providing employees with the necessary skills for optimal work so they
                                            provide opportunities for employees to learn through seminars and online
                                            classes. Also, the industry allows for gaining more knowledge of the skill
                                            through practice.
                                            These are the ways the industry and Academia cultivate documentation skills.

                                            For most types of documentation such as design documentation and process
                                            documentation a simple

                                            As regards Generating Documentation from source code some of the available
                                            technologies include:
                                            <ul>

                                                <li>Doxygen : This can be used for generating documentation from C++

                                                    other programming languages. </li>
                                                <li> Phpdocumentor:This can be used for generating documentation from

                                            It is worth noting that these tools for generating documentation from source
                                            code require some form of annotation in the source
                                            code that is supported by these tools.

                                            high-quality documentation through research work online, industry peoples
                                            experience through blogs, readily accessible design documents, and school

                                            I have also been privileged to practice my knowledge in various school

                                            required (mostly from the industry) which I have not had. For this reason,
                                            I assign 7 as my score. I have the foundation of the skill covered but
                                            require more practice to improve my expertise on this skill.
