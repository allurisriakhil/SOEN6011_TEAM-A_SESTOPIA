                                    <p>Regression testing is testing existing software applications to ensure that
                                        changes havenâ€™t broken any existing functionality. Its purpose is to get a hold
                                        of bugs which may have been accidentally introduced into a new released version
                                        and at the same time ensure that the previous removed bugs continue to stay
                                        dead. Changes like fixing bugs, enhancements in software, configuration changes
                                        and substitution of electronic components require regression testing.</p><br>

                                    <p>Functional testing is testing the â€˜Functionalityâ€™ of a software or an application
                                        under test. It tests the behavior of the software under test. Regression testing
                                        is a type of functional testing.</p>
                                    <p>Regression testing is carried out on receiving the build of the software after
                                        fixing the bugs that were found in the initial round of testing. It verifies
                                        whether the bugs are fixed and checks if the entire software is working fine
                                        with the changes.</p>

                                    <p> 1.Code that is being regression tested should be under a configuration
                                        management tool.<br>
                                        2.No changes must be allowed to code, during the regression test phase.<br>
                                        3.Regression test code must be kept immune to developer changes.<br>
                                        4.The database used for regression testing must be isolated.<br>
                                        5.No database changes should be allowed.<br>
                                        6.Configuration management.<br>
                                    </p>

                                    <p> To plan an effective regression testing one should determine first:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>what test-cases must be executed</li>
                                        <li>what must be improved and changed in the test-cases</li>
                                        <li>when it is necessary to execute regression testing of the system</li>
                                        <li>what and how should be automated</li>
                                        <li>what is needed to perform the automated testing</li>

                                    <p>UNIT TESTING:<br>
                                        Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units or
                                        components
                                        of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of
                                        the
                                        software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of
                                        any
                                        software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single
                                        output.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>INGTEGRATION SYSTEM:<br>

                                        Integration testing is a level of software testing where individual
                                        units are
                                        combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is
                                        to
                                        expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. Test drivers
                                        and test
                                        stubs are used to assist in Integration Testing.

                                        System testing is a level of testing that validates the complete and
                                        fully
                                        integrated software product. The purpose of a system test is to evaluate
                                        the
                                        end-to-end system specifications. Usually, the software is only one
                                        element of a
                                        larger computer-based system.

                                        system has met the requirement specifications. The main purpose of this
                                        test is
                                        to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and
                                        verify if
                                        meets the required criteria for delivery to end users.

                                    <p>The purpose of Regression Testing is to verify if code change introduces
                                        issues/defects into the existing functionality. There are so many kinds
                                        of
                                        possible changes that can impact the existing functionality in an
                                        application
                                        system. Even the simplest change to the code could impact the previously
                                        tested
                                        functionality. Regression is initiated when a programmer fixes any bug
                                        or adds a
                                        new code for new functionality to the system. There can be many
                                        dependencies in
                                        the newly added and existing functionality. It is a quality measure to
                                        check
                                        whether the new code complies with the old code so that the unmodified
                                        code is
                                        not getting affected. Most of the time the testing team has the task to
                                        check
                                        the last minute changes in the system. In such a situation, testing only
                                        affected application area is necessary to complete the testing process
                                        on time
                                        by covering all the major system aspects.
                                        This test is very important when there is a continuous
                                        change/improvement added
                                        in the application. The new functionality should not negatively affect
                                        the
                                        existing tested code. Regression is required to find the bugs that
                                        occurred
                                        because of a change in the code. If this testing is not done, the
                                        product might
                                        get critical issues in the live environment and that indeed can lead the
                                        customer into trouble.

                                        â€¢Regression testing can be used not only for testing the correctness of
                                        a
                                        program but often also for tracking the quality of its output. For
                                        instance, in
                                        the design of a compiler, regression testing could track the code size
                                        and the
                                        time it takes to compile and execute the test suite cases. Change in
                                        requirements and code is modified according to the requirement<br>
                                        â€¢New feature is added to the software<br>
                                        â€¢Defect fixing<br>
                                        â€¢Fixing performance issues<br>
                                        â€¢The overall purpose of regression testing is to easily and effectively
                                        uncover
                                        all possible software regressions, whether they were newly created
                                        (local /
                                        remote) or previously undiscovered (unmasked).<br>

                                    <p>An integral part of software testing, test artifacts are the various

                                        generated during the process of software testing, which are then shared
                                        with the
                                        clients, team managers, team lead, and other team members and
                                        stakeholders
                                        associated with the project. The main purpose of these artifacts is to
                                        establish
                                        transparency among the team members and therefore are recorded properly

                                        These artifacts help testers know the requirements of the clients and
                                        the
                                        stakeholders as well as allows them to ensure that there is no

                                        A real-world example of regression testing is that you take your car to
                                        a
                                        mechanic to get the air conditioning fixed, and when you get it back,
                                        the air
                                        conditioning is fixed but the gas tank sensor no longer works. Another
                                        example

                                        Automation regression testing : <br>

                                        <p>Automated regression testing is a way for a development team to
                                            improve the
                                            maintenance of a project, ensure high user retention rates, and
                                            reduce
                                            potential tech debt. With a wide range of third-party tools,
                                            automating
                                            regression testing is not as challenging as it would seem at first
                                            glance.
                                            An intelligent regression testing strategy includes knowing how to

                                        thorough understanding of regression testing. I was aware about software
                                        testing
                                        and various kinds of testing, but never studied anything in depth about
                                        it.The
                                        task of developing my skill template led me to research all I could
                                        about
                                        regression testing.Hence overall, it was an excellent learning
                                        experience for me
                                        .
